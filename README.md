Please see the README.md in the upstream (fork parent) repo: https://github.com/Walkman-Mirror/nternetinspired.github.com/blob/master/README.md

The reason for the Walkman-Mirror repo/fork situation is it seems Seth Warburton (@nternetinspired) deleted/made private his upstream repo at https://github.com/nternetinspired/nternetinspired.github.com/. I have forked [DonGilbert/dongilbert.github.io](https://github.com/dongilbert/dongilbert.github.io) to [Walkman-Mirror](https://github.com/Walkman-Mirror) since his fork seems to contain the most of Seth's commits, then removed all of Don's edits to leave a "mirror" repo that should be all of Seth's publicly available commits. You can see in the [network tab](https://github.com/Walkman-Mirror/nternetinspired.github.com/network) that it does seem that way, aulthough Don has a few more of Seths commits mixed in with his own.
